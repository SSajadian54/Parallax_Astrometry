# Parallax_Astrometry

Here, there are three *.cpp codes, which generate astrometric microelnsing events 
by including the parallax effect on astrometric source trajectory and lightcurves.  
Two first codes simulate events toward the Galactic bulge and the last one simulates
the events toward the LMC (Large Magellanic Cloud). In these codes synthetic data
points based on realistic observing strategies by Roman, LSST, and ELT are generated.  
The codes calculate the astrometric and photometric Fisher matrices.  

There are 6 *.py codes, which analyze the outputs and calculate the Covariance 
matrices for each simulated event. Three light*.py codes also plot lightcurves, 
and astrometric trajectories.  
One example of simulated lightcurves and astrometric trajectroies is attached.  

The main codes (*.cpp) read some files.  If you want to run the codes on your own 
computer, please contact me for that files.  My email address is:
